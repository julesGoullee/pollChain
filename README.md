Online petitions are a good opportunity for citizens to influence the world,
<br />
But those petitions have low credibility and a small impact because they are managed by centralized platforms that can organize the results for their own benefit.

GoodSign is a autonomous platform that promotes global causes through the creation, promotion and the signing of online petitions.

Decentralized,
Self-sovereign,
transparent
and secure.
